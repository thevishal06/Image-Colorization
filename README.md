Image Colorization: This project focuses on the process of transforming grayscale images into fully colorized versions using advanced algorithms. It aims to apply realistic colors that maintain the texture and details of the original image, while allowing users to upload their own grayscale photos through a user-friendly GUI. The model intelligently assigns colors based on various factors like object recognition, context, and historical data to achieve natural and visually appealing results.
